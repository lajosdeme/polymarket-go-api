# Authentication

Understanding authentication using Polymarket’s CLOB
The CLOB uses two levels of authentication: L1 (Private Key) and L2 (API Key). Either can be accomplished using the CLOB client or REST API. Authentication is not required to access client public methods and public endpoints.

## L1 Authentication
​
What is L1?
L1 authentication uses the wallet’s private key to sign an EIP-712 message used in the request header. It proves ownership and control over the private key. The private key stays in control of the user and all trading activity remains non-custodial.
​
What This Enables
Access to L1 methods that create or derive L2 authentication headers.

    Create user API credentials
    Derive existing user API credentials
    Sign/create user’s orders locally

REST API
While we highly recommend using our provided clients to handle signing and authentication, the following is for developers who choose NOT to use our Python or TypeScript clients. When making direct REST API calls with L1 authentication, include these headers:

Header	Required?	Description
POLY_ADDRESS	yes	Polygon signer address
POLY_SIGNATURE	yes	CLOB EIP 712 signature
POLY_TIMESTAMP	yes	Current UNIX timestamp
POLY_NONCE	yes	Nonce. Default 0

The POLY_SIGNATURE is generated by signing the following EIP-712 struct.
EIP-712 signing example:
```
const domain = {
  name: "ClobAuthDomain",
  version: "1",
  chainId: chainId, // Polygon Chain ID 137
};

const types = {
  ClobAuth: [
    { name: "address", type: "address" },
    { name: "timestamp", type: "string" },
    { name: "nonce", type: "uint256" },
    { name: "message", type: "string" },
  ],
};

const value = {
  address: signingAddress, // The Signing address
  timestamp: ts,            // The CLOB API server timestamp
  nonce: nonce,             // The nonce used
  message: "This message attests that I control the given wallet",
};

const sig = await signer._signTypedData(domain, types, value);
```

### Create API Credentials 

#### Create new API credentials for user.
```
POST {clob-endpoint}/auth/api-key
```

#### Derive API Credentials
Derive API credentials for user.
```
GET {clob-endpoint}/auth/derive-api-key
```

Response:
```
{
  "apiKey": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "secret": "base64EncodedSecretString",
  "passphrase": "randomPassphraseString"
}
```

You’ll need all three values for L2 authentication.

## L2 Authentication
### What is L2?
The next level of authentication is called L2, and it consists of the user’s API credentials (apiKey, secret, passphrase) generated from L1 authentication. These are used solely to authenticate requests made to the CLOB API. Requests are signed using HMAC-SHA256.

### What This Enables
Access to L2 methods such as posting signed/created orders, viewing open orders, cancelling open orders, getting trades

    - Cancel or get user’s open orders
    - Check user’s balances and allowances
    - Post user’s signed orders

**Even with L2 authentication headers, methods that create user orders still require the user to sign the order payload.**

### REST API
While we highly recommend using our provided clients to handle signing and authentication, the following is for developers who choose NOT to use our Python or TypeScript clients.

When making direct REST API calls with L2 authentication, include these headers:
Header	Required?	Description
POLY_ADDRESS	yes	Polygon signer address
POLY_SIGNATURE	yes	HMAC signature for request
POLY_TIMESTAMP	yes	Current UNIX timestamp
POLY_API_KEY	yes	User’s API apiKey value
POLY_PASSPHRASE	yes	User’s API passphrase value
The POLY_SIGNATURE for L2 is an HMAC-SHA256 signature created using the user’s API credentials secret value.

TypeScript reference implementation: https://github.com/Polymarket/clob-client/blob/main/src/signing/hmac.ts

### Signature Types and Funder
When initializing the L2 client, you must specify your wallet signatureType and the funder address which holds the funds:
Signature Type	Value	Description
EOA	0	Standard Ethereum wallet (MetaMask). Funder is the EOA address and will need POL to pay gas on transactions.
POLY_PROXY	1	A custom proxy wallet only used with users who logged in via Magic Link email/Google. Using this requires the user to have exported their PK from Polymarket.com and imported into your app.
GNOSIS_SAFE	2	Gnosis Safe multisig proxy wallet (most common). Use this for any new or returning user who does not fit the other 2 types.

The wallet addresses displayed to the user on Polymarket.com is the proxy wallet and should be used as the funder. These can be deterministically derived or you can deploy them on behalf of the user. These proxy wallets are automatically deployed for the user on their first login to Polymarket.com.

### Troubleshooting
#### Error: INVALID_SIGNATURE
Your wallet’s private key is incorrect or improperly formatted.
Solution:
    - Verify your private key is a valid hex string (starts with “0x”)
    - Ensure you’re using the correct key for the intended address
    - Check that the key has proper permissions

#### Error: NONCE_ALREADY_USED
The nonce you provided has already been used to create an API key.
Solution:
    - Use deriveApiKey() with the same nonce to retrieve existing credentials
    - Or use a different nonce with createApiKey()


#### Error: Invalid Funder Address
Your funder address is incorrect or doesn’t match your wallet.Solution: Check your Polymarket profile address at polymarket.com/settings.If it does not exist or user has never logged into Polymarket.com, deploy it first before creating L2 authentication.

#### Lost API credentials but have nonce
```
// Use deriveApiKey with the original nonce
const recovered = await client.deriveApiKey(originalNonce);
```

#### Lost both credentials and nonce
Unfortunately, there’s no way to recover lost API credentials without the nonce. You’ll need to create new credentials:
```
// Create fresh credentials with a new nonce
const newCreds = await client.createApiKey();
// Save the nonce this time!
```
